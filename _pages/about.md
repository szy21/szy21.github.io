I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in Environmental Science and Engineering at California Institute of Technology. Broadly, I am interested in clouds and aerosols, and their interactions with large-scale atmospheric dynamics and climate. My current research focuses on using large eddy simulations to understand boundary layer clouds and their feedbacks under global warming.
