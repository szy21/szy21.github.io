She works with [<u>Dr. Tapio Schneider</u>](https://climate-dynamics.org/people/tapio-schneider/) and her research focuses on understanding the dynamics of boundary layer clouds and their feedbacks under climate change.

Zhaoyi got her PhD in [<u>Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</u>](https://aos.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University in 2018, where she was advised by [<u>Dr. Yi Ming</u>](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/yi-ming-homepage/). Her doctoral work mainly focused on the impact of aerosols on large-scale circulation and regional climate. Before attending Princeton, Zhaoyi received her BS in Environmental Science, with a second BA in Economics, from Peking University in 2013. There, she was advised by Dr. Junfeng Liu and her undergraduate thesis focused on transpacific transport of black carbon.
